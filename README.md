## What is it?

It's a thing that wraps your NPM-like javascript modules into burritos and publishing them on S3 so you can use them as dependencies in your awesome Taco projects!

## Install

`$ npm install martinlissmyr/burrito -g`

## Usage

`$ cd myAwesomePackage` // Go to the package you want to publish  
`$ burrito config` // Shows your current configuration  
`$ burrito config:set` // Will let you set S3 keys and S3 bucket name  
`$ burrito publish` // Tar's the package, uploads it to S3 and gives you the URL

(when developing locally, replace burrito with `node index.js`)

## Add .burrito-config to .gitignore

Burrito will store your S3 config with your package locally. Make sure that you add `.burrito-config` to your `.gitignore` file so that you don't accidentaly share your credentials with the world.

## Note on using tgz files with NPM

You can specify the URLs generated by Burrito [directly as dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#urls-as-dependencies) in your `package.json`. In earlier versions of NPM you could experience some problems with accessing tgz file URLs â€“ so make sure that you've updated NPM.
